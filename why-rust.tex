  \frametitle{Why Rust? --- For Rubyists}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Great for small utility packages
    \begin{itemize}
    \item We have a gem to do some basic templating, with a single dependency on the {\footnotesize \mintinline{rust}{chef}} gem
    \item Bundled together size is 500MB, making things like containerization tedious
    \item A Rust binary for the same (WIP) would be a fraction of the size and embeddable anywhere
    \end{itemize}
  \item Easy to call Rust from Ruby using the {\footnotesize \mintinline{rust}{ffi}} gem
  \item Lots of community work done on enabling native Ruby extensions in Rust
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://usehelix.com/}{\textbf{Helix}} from Yehuda Katz and Skylight
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The Rust Lang Book \cite{RustLangEd}
  \item Beginner Friendly Ecosystem --- Rustup, Cargo, VSCode Plugin (RLS Integration) etc.
  \item Community that is accomodating of newcomers and is always glad to help
  \item Lot of scope for contributions (For eg: \href{https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/}{Rust Lang Nursery})
  \item CLI Infrastructure powered by Rust (For eg: \href{https://github.com/BurntSushi/riggrep/}{ripgrep}, \href{https://github.com/sharkdp/fd/}{fd})
  \end{itemize}
